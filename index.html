    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to our website we will tell you everything about<br>
    this, what are we about and why did we start this in the first place.</p>
    <h3>
        What are we about?
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are adults that use program to write code<br>
    We started this when we were a child so this was our dream<br>
    Making games was so intresting to us that we want to make 
    games too. <br>
    We currently Js for making websites.</p>
    <h4>
        Dyllan's Story
    </h4>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this website when I was a kid I got really<br>
    <b>excited</b> but before that when I was 9 years old I saw people make video games<br>
    I was so amazed that they could code advanced programs. So, I started <br>
    looking for game engiens but I was hopeless because I could not find one<br>
    So, I quit. I met this friend his name is Ryu we became best friends <br>
    I found out that Ryu make Microbit(robot) I was amazed but he was not good at real <br>
    coding so I saw a programming engien called Roblox Studio. It is a roblox <br>
    game maker that use the programming language Lua. But it was to hard I saw another one<br>
    called Unity. I saw it on a youtube video I picked up and wrote code with youtube<br>
    then before I finish the game, at school I saw a new one a website called AppLab
    <br>I was excited and got to work it use JavaScript I thought it was <br>hard but it was too
    easy because I already made a game in 2 days. <br>So I didn't like it but it came in with good use and I made this website with it</p>
